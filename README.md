You will slowly descend towards the bottom of the screen. Push **Spacebar** or click the **Left Mouse** button, to pull the hook up. Avoid touching the ground. To catch a fish, collide with it. You will get or lose points and/or score modifiers depending on the fish you catch. You have **60** seconds to score as much as you can. A higher score multiplier increases the amount of points you gain or lose when catching a fish.
